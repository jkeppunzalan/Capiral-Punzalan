  The players are divided into two roles; Imposter and Crewmate. The imposter’s goal is to kill all the crewmates. They can also sabotage the ship and if the crewmates don’t fix it in time, the imposters win. They also can vent. Venting is like going through a portal from one spot on the map to another. These spots are fixed. They can forcibly close doors as well.
The crewmates’ goal on the other hand is to finish all their tasks which are like mini-games around the ship.  They can also report dead bodies which cause a meeting to start. In this meeting, the crewmates discuss who could have killed and voted for the one they think it is. The one who is voted out is killed. Crewmates can also call a meeting by using the emergency meeting button near where everybody spawns.
