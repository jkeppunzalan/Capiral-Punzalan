<li>The Skeld - the doors cannot be reopened by the player. After 10 seconds of the door being closed, the door will reopen by itself.</li>
<li>Polus - the doors can be reopened by the player. They can do this by interacting with the door and flipping four switches. </li>
<li> Airship - the doors can be reopened by the player. They can do this by interacting with the door and swiping a card through a slot similar to the “Car Swipe” Task.</li>

                </ul>


<p>This can be fixed by the crewmates by going to Electricity and interacting with a panel that you are guided to by a yellow arrow on your screen indicating to you in which direction the panel is in. Upon interacting with the panel, you must flip the switches that are off on (the switch being on is indicated by a green light).</p>


<p>The panel can be interacted with multiple players at once, which could be inconvenient as the switch your turned on could be turned off by a fellow player who was trying to do the same thing</p>

                  <li>Be aware of Suspicious behavior</li>
<li>Imposters do not have tasks so they tend to bounce across the map, going in and out of rooms to look for who to kill. If you take note of this behavior in some of your fellow players, they are likely to be the imposter. Of course, an experienced imposter knows not to play like this so it will not work on them. But, inexperienced Imposters show this behavior

<li>Doing a visual task shows nearby Crewmates that can see you that you are guaranteed to be a Crewmate. Of course, for crewmates to be there to see you do the visual task; they have to be there. So during meetings, you should ask the players to come to watch you do the visual task. These players will then know that you are innocent and will vouch for you in the next meeting.

                  <li>Use CCTV</li>
<li>With the CCTV, you can watch certain parts of the map and catch an imposter in the act of killing or venting. Of course, knowledgeable imposters know not to kill when the cameras are on (indicated by cameras in the areas being watched having a red light). However, that means that the imposters will be more restricted when they kill since they can’t kill nearby or in the areas being watched. You can also use these areas as a safe zone when cameras are on since imposters wouldn't kill you because they would get caught.

                  <li>Travel in Groups (Don't be alone)</li>
<li>If you were to travel in groups, Imposters would not risk killing you as there would be a witness or witnesses if you’re with more than one player. Of course, there’s a chance that the player you’re with is the imposter but they’ll be unlikely to kill you if you’ve been stuck to them since the game started since if they kill you and the other players have seen you two together; they would be the prime suspect. So, you should probably stick to your group from the start of the game and travel with more than one person to assure that even if one of them is an Imposter and they are dumb enough to kill you; they would be reported by the other player (assuming they are not Imposter as well).</li>

<li>The taskbar moves when tasks are completed so when the Imposter fakes a task; the taskbar won’t move.

                  <p>Smart Venting</p>
<li>Venting is a powerful tool the imposter has to quickly move across the map or away from the body, however, if you are caught coming in or exiting a vent; you will get voted out. So, you must be careful when doing this. You must make sure the coast is clear before venting. Through sabotaging lights, you can limit the Crewmates’ vision; ensuring a bit of safety when you vent close to them.

                <ul>
                  <p>Sabotaging</p>
                  <li>Each sabotage, if used wisely, can be of major help to Imposters.</li>
                  <li>The instinctual reaction of  Crewmates, when there is sabotage, is to immediately go and fix it. Through this; you can kill a Crewmate, move away from the body through venting or just walking normally, sabotage, lure the majority or all of the players to one spot, go to the sabotaged area yourself, and blend in with the other players. This results in the body being unreported for a longer period of time than it would usually which allows your kill cooldown to go down a bit or even fully cool down; allowing you to kill again.  This also eliminates you from being suspicious as you wouldn’t be seen coming from the body. Additionally, the Crewmates wouldn’t know when the murder happened; putting them further in the dark.</li>
                  <li>Sabotaging also prevents the emergency button from being pressed and a meeting from starting. So if you are close to winning the game, the other players are suspicious of you, and your kill cooldown hasn’t ended yet, you can prevent them from calling a meeting and buy enough time for your kill cooldown to end; allowing you to kill one more and win the game</li>
                  <li>Sabotaging lights practically blind the Crewmates. You can get away with killing near Crewmates when the lights are off. So long as you get to Electric to supposedly fix lights from a different direction from where the body is, you can escape suspicion. Since the lights panel can be interacted with by multiple players at once, you can try switching off the switches that are on to extend the time of the lights being off. The purpose of this is to either troll the Crewmates or to buy time for your Imposter partner (assuming you’re playing in a lobby that has two imposters) to kill</li>
                  <li>Sabotaging doors can block players from finding a dead body or trap a Crewmate in the room for you to kill them(after killing them you should vent out since going out the door is risky as Crewmates could be waiting just outside).</li>

                <ul>
                  <p>Double kill</p>
<li>This is a strategy that can only be implemented by two imposters. This is done by killing at the same time as your partner when you are in sight of each other. This can be done as a game-winner; reducing the remaining crewmates to two, killing a witness to your partner’s murder(Note: only do this when there is one witness), or to simply just kill two Crewmates.

                <ul>
                  <p>Stack kill</p>
<li>This can be done when multiple players are so close together; they’re overlapping with one another. Once you join this “stack,” you kill and are not immediately deduced as the imposter since all the other remaining people in the stack are also considered suspects. 
This is a very risky strategy because if the stack isn’t dense(as in the closeness of each player to each other) enough, you could be found out as an imposter. So, only do this when the stack is dense with preferably more than 4 players. Also, you shouldn't kill immediately once you get into the stack as you would be considered the prime suspect if the kill happened right after you get into the stack.
