<html>There are four maps; the Skeld, Mira HQ, Polus, and the Airship.
Each map has CCTV which allows the players to look at parts of the map covered by cameras.
The Skeld can be described as a spaceship. It is the first map in the game. I say it’s the most normal out of all the maps as it doesn’t have any exaggerated features. It’s the second smallest out of all the maps.

Mira HQ is a complex in the sky. All the vents (refer to Gameplay) connect on the map. It's also the smallest map

Polus is a base set on a planet. It is larger than both Mira HQ and the Skeld. The doors when closed by imposters (refer to Gameplay ) have to be opened manually.

The Airship is the largest map in Among Us. It also happens to be the most recent.
